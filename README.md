## CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Use Spotify API -> You can link two Spotify Playlists and produce the following:
   - List of shared songs
   - List of songs with shared or similar artists (if not enough songs match)
   - List of unique songs (removes duplicates) <-- Good for merging your own playlists
And at the end you can export the list as a playlist and save it.


## OPTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY:
- Link several Spotify Playlists and produce the same information as above (good for parties!)
